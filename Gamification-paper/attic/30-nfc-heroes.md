### NFC Heroes

Despite promising a “gamification-based approach” in the abstract and “gamification” being in the title, there isn't any gamification presented in “Research in the Large: Challenges for Large-Scale Mobile Application Research – A Case Study about NFC Adoption Using Gamification via an App Store” 

The “gamification” in the title refers to NFC Heroes, which is “a virtual trading card game for Android phones, slightly inspired by the Magic: The Gathering trading card game. Users can scan NFC tags to unlock more powerful spells or heroes in the game.”

But our working definition of gamification includes as a requirement ‘to show the user how outcomes integrate into achieving goals.’  Yet for NFC Heroes, “the goal of this project is to capture the current state of deployment of NFC solutions”.  There is nothing in the game mechanics that reveals this goal to the user, or demonstrates how the outcomes of user actions integrate into this goal.

And, if it did qualify as a gamified application, NFC Heroes would be exploitationware, since “most users are unaware of the game's purpose as a research project”.
