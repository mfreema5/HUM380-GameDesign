### Motivations &ndash; workplace focus

Self-determination theory is a work motivation theory that focuses “on the relative strength of autonomous versus controlled motivation” (Gagné and Deci 2005). Much as with game-focused motivation and the desire to play a game, the strength of *autonomy* in motivations has a ‘very strong’ influence on work performance.

The motivations with the highest autonomy are intrinsic motivations, which under self-determination theory are motivations that stem solely from an inherent, internal interest (Gagné and Deci 2005) or enjoyment (Ryan and Deci 2000) in an activity.

Extrinsic motivations are those that depend on a contingency between an action and some external consequence, and within self-determination theory they are placed on “a self-determination continuum” (Gagné and Deci 2005) depending on the level of autonomy they comprise.  The extrinsic motivations with the most autonomy are integrated extrinsic motivations, and the least self-determined are external extrinsic motivations.

Since internalized extrinsic motivations are highly autonomous, they are largely indistinguishable in terms of workplace performance from intrinsic motivations.  There are two ways that those can be distinguished: A) integrated extrinsic motivations started out as external, but over time became integrated, and B) integrated extrinsic motivations are not required to be enjoyable or interesting.

However, the latter distinction is problematic.  Ferrara describes the phenomenon of players “grinding” through parts of a game: 

> “[Being motivated by fun] doesn’t account for the nearly masochistic things people
are willing to do when playing a game. Many of the most popular role-playing games, for example, require players to fight the same enemies over and over again (and then again and again) to get the experience and loot they need to advance in the game. Players may spend dozens of hours in thousands f battles. So many games involve these kinds of endless repetitive actions that the gaming community has given it a name: grinding. This term is related to how we describe work we really don’t enjoy&mdash;as ‘a grind.’ So why do people pay good money to subject themselves to something that’s as unpleasant as the work an employer would pay them to do? This is a really big problem if your only explanation for why people play games is to have fun.” (Ferrara 2012) 

Those players are volunteering to play the game; they are not motivated by some external consequence.  Therefore their motivation is not an extrinsic one.  But if it's not an extrinsic motivation, then presumably it's an intrinsic motivation, yet “grinding” through a game is neither interesting or pleasurable.

While self-determination theory is useful for its method of using autonomy as an indicator of the relative strength of a motivation, its distinction between integrated extrinsic motivations and intrinsic motivations that is based on interest and enjoyment likely isn't.  Indeed, a cornerstone of Reiss' Theory of 16 Basic Desires (Reiss 2004), which is covered in the next section, is the rejection of the requirement for intrinsic motivations to be pleasurable.
