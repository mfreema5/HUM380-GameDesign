# Practical gamification literature &ndash; evaluated against theory

The practical gamification literature can be critically evaluated using the combination of the theory side of the gamification literature and the motivation theories from other fields in the earlier sections.  Which is what I in the following, describing some examples of where practical gamification has failed to apply gamification in a way supported by theory.

The general recommendation is that gamification projects start by defining the goals of the projects.  So, the first examples from practical gamification literature are related to project goals. 

One of the difficulties of setting the goals of a gamification project is find a proper balance between the goals of the organization, and the goals of the user.  Since that balance will be particular to every project, it can be difficult to judge the appropriateness of the balance implemented, but there are a couple of guidelines. The first is a simple one: any project that completely ignores user goals does not have an appropriate balance of user and organization goals.  The second is to check the project against the “value destruction risks”, a.k.a. “The Seven Deadly Sins” of gamification described by Raftopoulos (2014).

The first example is one that fails the simple guideline of gamification project goals: don't ignore user goals.  As referred to an earlier section, the authors of “*A Case Study in the Gamification of a University-Level Games Development Course*” give the organization's goals as the project's goals, and don't include any users goals. “Our goal with gamification was to improve lecture attendance,￼content understanding, problem solving skills and general￼engagement. The success of this intervention was measured using￼course marks, lecturer evaluations, lecture attendance, and a￼questionnaire…” (O’Donovan *et al.* 2013).

That project also manages to fail when checked against the seven deadly sins.  After first explaining that purpose of gamification is to use “game design techniques [to] manipulate users’ behaviour with a high degree of certainty”, they go on to recommend hiding that manipulation in order to maintain an illusion of autonomy, because “…if users feel that they are being manipulated, they may notice that their freedom within the product is an illusion” (O’Donovan *et al.* 2013).  Not only is this is the “homogenization of the workforce” warned about in the seven deadly sins, but it seems to go a step beyond that.  “Value destruction item 4” warns of an unintentional homogenization of the workforce through a “normative influence” that leads to a reduced “capacity for divergent thinking for creative problem-solving and innovation” (Raftopoulos 2014), but the intentional manipulation of users, wrapped in an illusory autonomy, would seem to indicate an equally intentional attempt to have a “normative influence” on users.

The project described in “*Research in the Large: Challenges for Large-Scale Mobile Application Research* &ndash; *A Case Study about NFC Adoption Using Gamification via an App Store*” also fails to include any hint of user's goals in the goals of the gamification project. As mentioned previously, this project also went beyond simple ignoring user's goals, by actively hiding the project's purely organization goals, from users of the data collection application disguised as a game. The authors report that “most users are unaware of the game's purpose as a research project”, and later describe their intentional obfuscation of the project's goals: “[we] chose a neutral name for our game that did not disclose its nature as a research project, but did rather seem like a game of an independent development studio” (Kranz 2013).

When the project goals do account for user goals, it is important to consider how those goals align with the motivations that game design elements can promote.  Failing to align gamified motivations with user goals will fail to motivate users.

An example of this can be seen in “*Gamifying Intelligent Environments*”, where the authors fail to understand the link between user goals and motivations.  They write that for gamification to work “designer[s] should build the system as a fun application to interact (play) with. We believe that the expected game-like behaviors will only arise when user is truly having a fun experience…” (Liu *et al.* 2011).  They were explaining the failure of their gamification project “EcoIsland” to motivate users, as a lack of ‘fun’, writing that “a fun experience requires much more than simply adding basic game mechanics: well-designed avatars, content, flow, user interface and interaction model are all needful components for a successful gamification implementation.”  But without an explanation of user motivations, there is no reason to believe that any or all of those game design elements would be necessary for a game to be ‘fun’.

Liu *et al.* (2011) know that the users EcoIsland are motivated by an “environmentally friendly mind” and an “interests of saving energy”, which presumably falls under the intrinsic motivation of ‘idealism’.  Yet the game design elements they describe, such as “virtual items [to] decorate their islands” and a mechanic such that “successful [emissions rights] sellers can afford to decorate their island more”, would seem to feed a ‘status’ motive.

EcoIsland wasn't fun for users, but not because it lacked avatars, but because it failed to have game design elements that aligned with the users' desire to improve society, and for altruism and justice.  For example, the game included a mechanic where the sea-level around their personal island rose and fell based on the CO2-emissions of their self-reported activities; an additional mechanic where-by the sea-level around a user's island had a similar influence on the sea-level of neighboring islands would appeal to an idealism motive more than would a badge to show to neighbors.

Similarly, the authors of “*Gamification in Logistics and Supply Chain Education: Extending Active Learning*” don't consider their users' motivations when deciding what game design elements should be included when they explain the utility of leaderboards and inter-user comparisons.

>“Feedback needs be provided to students so that they can compare and contrast their own performance with that of their peers. It will become necessary to incorporate some form of the leaderboard or publication of results; even if these are not tied to particular students (we do not wish to breach privacy considerations). Such publications would allow an individual to understand where they are in comparison to their classmates; they may be able to determine that they are on the lower end of the class, motivating them to perform better in the future. …Staff can upload the results soon after assessments, ensuring students can perceive in near-to-real-time, how they are progressing in comparison to their classmates.”  (Wood and Reiners 2012)

In addition to not understanding that aggregating results onto a leaderboard largely defeats any feedback on specific behaviors, since it is rarely timely enough and the aggregation obscures what part of the results are tied to what behavior, they also don't explain what exactly would be behind the motivation “to perform better in the future”.  While in general a leaderboard can encourage a user who has a desire for social standing, an anonymous board wouldn't, since other users couldn't see that user's rank.  Similarly the anonymity would lower its impact on a user's desire to compete or to win, since she wouldn't be competing against any specific users.

And, finally, an example from the area of gamification literature that offers practical advice on gamification.  The author of “*Gamifying Support*” gets off to a good start, by stating that “Points serve as feedback and track progression”, and by recommending that points are tied to “the behaviors your company wants to reinforce” (Sampanes 2013).

However, when later describing how points can applied to customer support engineers, while they are referred to as being part of a “feedback loop”, they are no longer actually feedback.  Instead, they have become a work-performance metric: “How customers respond to survey’s about the quality of their interaction… could provide another source of points for the engineer.… The feedback loop for them seeing the points accumulated from “tough” calls and how this is tracked and shared with the organization can help keep the engineer focused on the solution while working to keep their composure in stressful times. Other metrics, based on analytics within a call or support center can also drive points, badges, and esteem…” (Sampanes 2013).

Also, the author's only explanation for why a customer support engineer would be motivated to “overcome harder challenges” and “attain higher levels” is that doing so would “brings novelty into their work environment (where there otherwise wasn’t)” (Sampanes 2013). In other words, the only motivation is the obvious ‘fun’ to be had.

Ironically, the author explains one of the potential hazards of gamification as: “Gamifying support could result in dehumanifying customers. Be careful that support engineers don’t get so caught up in the ‘game’ that they forget that customers are individuals whose feelings and thoughts must be considered throughout the process” (Sampanes 2013).

This is ironic because the game is, in fact, dehumanifying the *employees*.  Indeed, the customer support engineer gamification as described in “Gamifying Support” easily embodies four of the seven deadly sins of gamification (Raftopoulos 2014).

1. *Coercive participation* &ndash; users that “are under pressure and obligation to perform and are aware that they are being scrutinized, measured and evaluated” are less likely to have a gameful experience
1. *The technological whip* &ndash; the gamified system is used by the organization for surveillance, monitoring and performance tracking.
1. *Homogenization of the workforce* &ndash; “self optimizing systems” encourage behavioral conformity, but do not shift attitudes; creativity and individuality are discouraged.
1. *Shallow and inauthentic* &ndash; the gamified system is less about fun than about distracting employees from organizational dysfunctions and the methods by which the organization is controlling them.
