# Game design elements

The purpose of gamification is to improve an non-game application by using game design elements, but exactly what are they?

Game design elements are “elements that are characteristic to games – elements that are found in most (but not necessarily all) games, readily associated with games, and found to play a significant role in gameplay” (Deterding *et al.* 2011). Those elements must also be implemented in ways similar to the way they are in games. E.g., an application can have “levels” in order to structure content or access, which are not game-like “levels” that are tied to progression through the game.  However, if there is a connection between an application's “levels” and progression toward a goal, then those “levels” would be an example of a game design element.

## Goals, motivations, and games design elements

A gamification project has goals, toward which users are directed by motivations.  Those motivations are strengthened by appropriate game design elements.  Ferrara (2012) gives examples of how design and design elements in games can be used to appeal to players with common motivations.

* **Autonomy** &ndash; Games can give players an increased sense of freedom by giving them multiple objects from which to choose, and a variety of ways to meet those objectives.  By not imposing time restraints, and not forcing players through parts of a game that don't interest them, games can let players enjoy their autonomy.

* **Competence** &ndash; Players motivated by confidence need the challenge to their skills to constantly increase&ndash;if the game becomes too easy, they'll lose interest.  However, it's impossible to create a sequence of increases in difficulty that appeal to all players.  So, a common approach is to make the standard sequence increase in difficulty at a rate that only the best players can keep pace with, then offer options to help other players advance. <br /> Players can be helped by giving them the option to choose a lower level of difficulty.  Or, there can be ways for players to earn items or features that will assist them.  Also, coaching players or having “practice” areas with little risks can help players build the skills they need to be good enough at playing the game to enjoy it.

* **Social Image** &ndash; Players motivated by wanting to maintain or improve their social image will want a game to provide ways to compare achievements between players.  They will enjoy having ways to display their achievements, such as items acquired in the game, or badges earned, and will expect to be able to view others achievements.

* **Creativity** &ndash; In a game appealing to the player's desire to be creative, the player will not be tied to any particular objective.  An easy-to-use interface will allow the player to create a wide variety of things, which are readily identified as distinct from other player's creations.  And the game will provide a way for the player to showcase her creations.

Everywhere in the gamification literature, if any specific game design elements are discussed the one that seemingly is always included is ‘points!’.  Which is why it merits its own section, which follows.
