#### Motivations &ndash; game focus

The list of motivations in “Playful Design &ndash; Creating game experiences in everyday interfaces” (Ferrara 2012) is from the perspective of a game designer.  It attempts to answer the question of why people are motivated to play the games they play.

* *Autonomy* &ndash; People are motivated to play games in which they have freedom of action. Players' enjoyment of a game “is very strongly related” to “the degree of autonomy” that it gives them.
* *Immersion* &ndash; Games that give players a “deep experience of immersion” create the possibility for achieving “flow” (Csikszentmihalyi 1991). The resulting “feelings of contentment and well-being, even euphoria” motivate players to play the game.
* *Competence* &ndash People want to feel that they are competent at some chosen activity; they desire to improve their skills and abilities, and the rising difficulty so some games gives players the opportunity to do this.
* *Catharsis* &ndash; Players can experience a sense of cathartic relief by expressing within a game their aggressive reactions to tensions in their lives.  They are motivated to play the game to feel that catharsis.
* *Accomplishment* &ndash; Overcoming the challenges in a game to achieve a goal can give players a sense of accomplishment.  People who can't satiate their desire for accomplishment in the non-game world will be motivated to accomplish tasks in games.
* *Social Image* &ndash; A game can provide a platform in which players can show off their skills and achievements.  Unlike being motivated by *competence*, when motivated by *social image* players acquire skills in order to improve (or maintain) their social rank.
* *Social Interaction* &ndash; People all desire some amount of social interaction; for people who are not socializing as much as they want, a game can be a pretext to engage in social interaction.
* *Creativity* &ndash; A desire to express themselves and their imaginations through acts of creation can motivate players to play games that provide opportunities to do so.
