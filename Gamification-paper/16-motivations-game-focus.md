#### Motivations &ndash; game focus

There is a list of motivations in “Playful Design &ndash; Creating game experiences in everyday interfaces” (Ferrara 2012) that is from the perspective of a game designer.  It attempts to answer the question of why people are motivated to play the games they play.

* *Autonomy* &ndash; People are motivated to play games in which they have freedom of action. Players' enjoyment of a game “is very strongly related” to “the degree of autonomy” that it gives them.
* *Immersion* &ndash; Games that give players a “deep experience of immersion” create the possibility for achieving “flow” (Csikszentmihalyi 1991). The resulting “feelings of contentment and well-being, even euphoria” motivate players to play the game.
* *Competence* &ndash People want to feel that they are competent at some chosen activity; they desire to improve their skills and abilities, and the rising difficulty so some games gives players the opportunity to do this.
* *Catharsis* &ndash; Players can experience a sense of cathartic relief by expressing within a game their aggressive reactions to tensions in their lives.  They are motivated to play the game to feel that catharsis.
* *Accomplishment* &ndash; Overcoming the challenges in a game to achieve a goal can give players a sense of accomplishment.  People who can't satiate their desire for accomplishment in the non-game world will be motivated to accomplish tasks in games.
* *Social Image* &ndash; A game can provide a platform in which players can show off their skills and achievements.  Unlike being motivated by *competence*, when motivated by *social image* players acquire skills in order to improve (or maintain) their social rank.
* *Social Interaction* &ndash; People all desire some amount of social interaction; for people who are not socializing as much as they want, a game can be a pretext to engage in social interaction.
* *Creativity* &ndash; A desire to express themselves and their imaginations through acts of creation can motivate players to play games that provide opportunities to do so.

Unfortunately, looking at motivation through the lens of game design largely gives you an understanding of how those motivations interact with in-game activities.  But for gamification, what is needed is an understanding of the how motivations are related to those “aspects of the underlying non-game activity that are being transformed with game design elements” (Nicholson 2012).

To do that we'll next consider self-determination theory.
