<title>Gamification - literature review<\title>

# Introduction

The literature on Gamification can be divided into three categories: theory, guides, and case studys. “Guides” are sources that range from general recommendations based on theory, to recommendations of specific mechanics.  The former are related to “theory” papers, and the latter to “case studies”. This review divides the literature that way into two groups: the first is sources with theory and theory-based broad recommendations; the second is sources with more practical recommendations, and case studies.

I look first at the theory side of gamification, focusing on the definition of gamification, and discussion of goals and objectives of gamification.  I then review some sources borrowed from other fields on the subject of player/user motivation, which helps bridge the gap from theory to practice.  I then review the practical advice and case studies against the concepts in the theory sources.
