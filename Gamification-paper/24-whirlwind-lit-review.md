## A whirlwind literature review

The previous sections may seem like an excessive amount of space to spend on theories of human motivation in a paper ostensibly about gamification.  But a solid foundation in some of the ways to analyze and discuss motivations, along with a good understanding of the difference between user and organizational goals, would seem to be important for a review of the gamification literature.  Because much of that literature seems to be missing an appropriate understanding of either user v. organizational goals, or motivations, or both.

This section contains some brief examples.

#### “Gamifying Intelligent Environments”

* Liu, Yefeng, Todorka Alexandrova, and Tatsuo Nakajima. 2011. “Gamifying Intelligent Environments.” In *Proceedings of the 2011 International ACM Workshop on Ubiquitous Meta User Interfaces, 7–12. ACM*. doi:10.1145/2072652.2072655.

In the conclusion, the authors of “*Gamifying Intelligent Environments*” write, “Designer[s] should build the system as a fun application to interact (play) with. We believe that the expected game-like behaviors will only arise when user is truly having a fun experience…”.  The notion that ‘fun’ is the primary motivation for playing games is dismissed by game-focused motivation theories. 

The authors go on to say that, “a fun experience requires much more than simply adding basic game mechanics: well-designed avatars, content, flow, user interface and interaction model are all needful components for a successful gamification implementation”.  None of those requisite features inherently improve the autonomy of users, so according to self-determination theory, there is no reason to assume that they would increase user motivations.

The author's also fail to understand that gamified elements need to align with user motivations.  While they know that the users of one of their example gamified systems are motivated by an “environmentally friendly mind” and an “interests of saving energy”, they don't explain how their design supports those motivations.  How do elements like “virtual items [to] decorate their islands” and a mechanic that “successful [emissions rights] sellers can afford to decorate their island more” relate to users that are motivated by environmental concerns?  Applying Reiss' 16 motives, the designers seem to be providing users with an ‘idealism’ motive with a mechanic that feeds a ‘status’ motive.

#### “Gamification in Logistics and Supply Chain Education: Extending Active Learning”

* Wood, L. C., and T. Reiners. 2012. “Gamification in Logistics and Supply Chain Education: Extending Active Learning.” In *IADIS International Conference on Internet Technologies & Society 2012*. Perth, Australia: IADIS Press. http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/handle/10292/6202.

The authors of “*Gamification in Logistics and Supply Chain Education: Extending Active Learning*” only seem to go off the rails when explaining why “leaderboards and comparisons” would be an improvement.

>“Feedback needs be provided to students so that they can compare and contrast their own performance with that of their peers. It will become necessary to incorporate some form of the leaderboard or publication of results; even if these are not tied to particular students (we do not wish to breach privacy considerations). Such publications would allow an individual to understand where they are in comparison to their classmates; they may be able to determine that they are on the lower end of the class, motivating them to perform better in the future. …Staff can upload the results soon after assessments, ensuring students can perceive in near-to-real-time, how they are progressing in comparison to their classmates.”

Timely feedback is key to keeping users motivated.  But feedback should integrate into the overall progression through the system.  The proposed feedback doesn't do that&mdash;it only shows a user her relative rank in the class. So the leaderboard doesn't help create a gameful experience.

And to what motivation does it relate? Anonymous rankings don't promote a social image/status motive or any of the motives that non-anonymous leaderboards might.  Knowing her rank in class won't improve a user's sense of autonomy.  Worse, focusing on an external outcome such as a leaderboard, can shift her intrinsic motivations into extrinsic ones.

#### “A Case Study in the Gamification of a University-Level Games Development Course”

* O’Donovan, Siobhan, James Gain, and Patrick Marais. 2013. “A Case Study in the Gamification of a University-Level Games Development Course.” In *Proceedings of the South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists Conference, 242–51. SAICSIT ’13*. New York, NY, USA: ACM. doi:10.1145/2513456.2513469.

As referenced earlier, the authors of “*A Case Study in the Gamification of a University-Level Games Development Course*” give the organization's goals priority over those of the users, not including the latter at all: “Our goal with gamification was to improve lecture attendance,￼content understanding, problem solving skills and general￼engagement. The success of this intervention was measured using￼course marks, lecturer evaluations, lecture attendance, and a￼questionnaire….”

The authors confuse gamification with “pointsification” (Robertson 2010) with gamification:

>“Gamification… applies reward-based games design elements to tasks, such as visiting a website or using a product, in order to motivate the target market to engage in these tasks more often and deeply.”

And they confuse promoting intrinsic motivation with manipulation: “Gamification is applied to systems where specific user behaviour is desired. This requires that the game design techniques manipulate users’ behaviour with a high degree of certainty”.

They later explain that while they believe that good gamification manipulates behavior (instead of improving motivations) this should be hidden from users by creating a “illusion” of autonomy: “…if users feel that they are being manipulated, they may notice that their freedom within the product is an illusion”.

#### “Research in the Large: Challenges for Large-Scale Mobile Application Research &ndash; A Case Study about NFC Adoption Using Gamification via an App Store”

* Kranz, Matthias, Lukas Murmann, and Florian Michahelles. 2013. “Research in the Large: Challenges for Large-Scale Mobile Application Research- A Case Study about NFC Adoption Using Gamification via an App Store.” *International Journal of Mobile Human Computer Interaction* 5 (1): 45–61. doi:10.4018/jmhci.2013010103.

As mentioned previously, the project detailed in “Research in the Large: Challenges for Large-Scale Mobile Application Research- A Case Study about NFC Adoption Using Gamification via an App Store” is most notable for its goals.  More exactly, for actively hiding the project's goals, which were purely organization goals, from users of the data collection application disguised as a game.

The authors report that “most users are unaware of the game's purpose as a research project”, and later describe their intentional obfuscation of the project's goals: “[we] chose a neutral name for our game that did not disclose its nature as a research project, but did rather seem like a game of an independent development studio”.

### “Gamifying Support”

* Sampanes, Anthony Chad. 2013. “Gamifying Support.” In *Human-Computer Interaction. Applications and Services*, edited by Masaaki Kurosu, 284–91. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8005. Springer Berlin Heidelberg. doi:10.1007/978-3-642-39262-7_32.

The author of “Gamifying Support” gets off to a good start, by stating that “Points serve as feedback and track progression”, and by recommending that points are tied to “the behaviors your company wants to reinforce”.

However, when describing how points can applied to customer support engineers, while they are  referred to as being part of a “feedback loop” they are no longer feedback.  Instead, they have become a work-performance metric: “How customers respond to survey’s about the quality of their interaction… could provide another source of points for the engineer.… The feedback loop for them seeing the points accumulated from “tough” calls and how this is tracked and shared with the organization can help keep the engineer focused on the solution while working to keep their composure in stressful times. Other metrics, based on analytics within a call or support center can also drive points, badges, and esteem….”

Also, the author's only explanation for why a customer support engineer would be motivated to “overcome harder challenges” and “attain higher levels” is that doing so would “brings novelty into their work environment (where there otherwise wasn’t)”.  In other words, the only motivation is the obvious ‘fun’ to be had.

In a final irony, the author explains one of the potential hazards of gamification: “Gamifying support could result in dehumanifying customers. Be careful that support engineers don’t get so caught up in the ‘game’ that they forget that customers are individuals whose feelings and thoughts must be considered throughout the process.”

Which is ironic because the game is dehumanifying the employees.  Indeed, the customer support engineer gamification as described in “Gamifying Support” easily embodies four of the seven “Value Destruction Risks” of gamification (Raftopoulos 2014).

* *Coercive participation* &ndash; users that “are under pressure and obligation to perform and are aware that they are being scrutinized, measured and evaluated” are less likely to have a gameful experience
* *The technological whip* &ndash; the gamified system is used by the organization for surveillance, monitoring and performance tracking.
* *Homogenization of the workforce* &ndash; “self optimizing systems” encourage behavioral conformity, but do not shift attitudes; creativity and individuality are discouraged.
* *Shallow and inauthentic* &ndash; the gamified system is less about fun than about distracting employees from organizational dysfunctions and the methods by which the organization is controlling them.
