### Support and reinforce motivations

Identify ways to support & reinforce employee motivations with game elements


1. Use game elements (‘points!’) to provide timely, situated feedback
    * “Feedback needs to be specific and relevant if it is to motivate…. We already know that goals will not be effective without feedback, and performance information helps people clarify expectancies….” (Siegall 1988)



1. Make sure any rewards communicate the right goals
    * “Reward presented repeatedly in a nonsalient fashion for a high degree of divergent thinking acts to increase subsequent creativity on an entirely new task. …In contrast, rewarding a low degree of originality produces a decrease in generalized creativity.” (Eisenberger and Cameron 1996)
