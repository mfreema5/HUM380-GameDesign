### Motivations

The promise of gamification is motivation&mdash;people will *want* to use the gamified application (Deterding 2012).

The gamification literature has sparse coverage of motivation theory, so for this review I will borrow from other fields.  There are three parts to this section, the first considers motivations as understood through the games that people are motivated to play; the second covers motivations as they relate to workplace performance; and the third covers the underlying desires that drive all human behavior, and the  motivations that tie the desires to the behaviors.
