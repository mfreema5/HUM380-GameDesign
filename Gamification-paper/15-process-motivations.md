### Motivations

The promise of gamification is motivation.  People will *want* to use the gamified application.

Some sources go on at length about the value of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivations. According to self-determination theory, the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations is not the best predictor of performance, since not all extrinsic motivations are the same. Self-determination theory describes a spectrum of extrinsic motivations distinguished by the extent to which they have been internalized.  Highly-internalized extrinsic motivations are almost indistinguishable from intrinsic motivations in terms of workplace performance.  These motivations are classified as autonomous motivations; they are motives that both express and foster an individuals sense of self-determination.  It is the level of self-determination that predicts how much a motivation will positively impact work performance.

Reiss' 16 Motives theory subdivides intrinsic motivations into 16 types, which are supported as being distinct influences on behavior by empirical studies. In this theory, the highly-integrated extrinsic motivations of self-determination theory are considered as intrinsic motivations, since intrinsic motivations are only required to lead to the satiation of desires, and are not required to be inherently pleasurable (Reiss 2004). The latter is a requirement of  self-determination theory, in which intrinsic motivations are definitionally distinguished from highly-integrated extrinsic motivations by being interesting (Gagné and Deci 2005) and/or enjoyable (Ryan and Deci 2000) to an individual.

Irrespective of whether or not intrinsic and highly integrated extrinsic motivations should be conceptually separated as they are in self-determination theory, the theory is still useful. It provides a useful predictor for the performance impact of a motivation: autonomy.  All other things being equal, the more autonomous a motivation, the stronger it is.

Game design elements that increase a user's sense and expression of autonomy will increase the user's motivation to use the application.

Reiss' 16 Motives is useful for the motivation alignment of game design elements and the user.  For example, one of the 16 motives *status*, is defined as “Desire for social standing (including desire for attention)” (Reiss 2004).  Game elements that highlight a user's social standing&mdash;counts of friends; public postings of “Thank You” messages; leaderboards&mdash;will align with a motivation for *status*, and help increase it.  However, those same game elements will align poorly with *curiosity* (“Desire for knowledge”), and so will have little effect on it.

The 16 motives are also useful for bridging motivations back to system goals.  The motivations are not required to be pleasurable because they are instead tied to the satiation of a desire.  *Curiosity* satiates the desire for knowledge; people who are not strongly motivated by *curiosity* have a desire for knowledge that is easily satiated.  People not strongly motivated by *status* have a low desire for social standing.

Gamified applications can align with these motives and goals through a number of design choices.  What behaviors are rewarded with feedback, and what form that feedback takes; what things are tracked as indicators of progress; what challenges must be overcome to advance.

If the main goal of a system is to increase knowledge, then *curiosity* is a motivation that game design elements should be fueling. Appropriate game design elements might give feedback that reinforces behaviors like exploration, or experimentation.  They should not give feedback that reinforces covering the same material over and over, e.g., farming a particular location in a large game space. 

In another example, if creativity is the goal, then a system should reward creativity: “Reward presented repeatedly in a nonsalient fashion for a high degree of divergent thinking acts to increase subsequent creativity on an entirely new task. …In contrast, rewarding a low degree of originality produces a decrease in generalized creativity.” (Eisenberger and Cameron 1996)

Game design elements should also not be detached from the central motivations and goals of the system.  They can become a sort of counter-motivating feedback, as users become lost in the disconnect between the system's goals and the game-design layer.  “Feedback needs to be specific and relevant if it is to motivate…. We already know that goals will not be effective without feedback, and performance information helps people clarify expectancies…” (Siegall 1988).
