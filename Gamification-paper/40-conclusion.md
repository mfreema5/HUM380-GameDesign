## Conclusion

The definition of gamification is still not solidified.  An element-centric definition such as the one offered by Deterding *et al.* (2011) is most common, but there are also a number of experience-centric definitions, e.g., the definition given by Huotari and Hamari (2012).

The primary area of discourse in the practice of gamification seems to be project goals (cf. Deterding 2012, Ferrara 2012, Nicholson 2012, Conway 2014, Raftopoulos 2014).  Should gamification projects primarily focus on achieving organization goals; should they primarily focus on achieving user goals; or should they strike some balance between the two?  There are recommendations for ensuring the inclusion of user goals in gamification project goals (Nicholson 2012, Raftopoulos 2014) but no guidelines beyond simple inclusion.

Issues of motivation are often reduced to simplistic distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, and to make things more difficult, motivations are confused with rewards.  Viewing motivations through a work-motivation lense, such as self-determination theory, is likely appropriate and useful for ranking the strength of motivations.  However, a more fine-grained view of motivation, such as provided by Reiss (2004), might provide a way to better map motivations to both goals, and to game design elements.
