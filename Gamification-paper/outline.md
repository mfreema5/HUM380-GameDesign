### Outline

1. What is gamification?
  1. What is a digital game?
    1. Gamification largely a phenomenon of digital platforms, so restrict to digital games
    1. A digital game creates meaningful play (Salen and Zimmerman 2004)
      1. Meaning emerges from relationship between action and outcome
      1. Those relationships must be “discernable” and “integrated”
        * **discernable** &ndash; an action has an immediate outcome, that the player can *discern*
        * **integrated** &ndash; an action's outcome has an effect in the larger game system; it is *integrated* with the other outcomes of other actions in the overall game
  1. What is gamification?
    1. Gamification tries to create a game-like experience in a non-game setting.  
      1. Obvious indication of gamification: game design elements in a non-game setting
        * “…We propose the following definition: ‘Gamification’ is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.” (Deterding *et al.* 2011)
      1. But mechanics alone do not create a gameful experience
        * “Past definitions rely on the notion that gamification is based on the use of game elements. However, there doesn’t seem to exist a clearly defined set of game elements which would be strictly unique to games, neither [do] they automatically create gameful experiences. We can find similar elements from a variety of non-game contexts as well. …We argue that the definition of gamification (nor games) cannot be based on a set of methods or mechanics, but instead it has to be understood more broadly as a process in which the gamifier is attempting to increase the likelihood for the gameful experiences to emerge by imbuing the service with affordances for that purpose (be it badges or more implicit cues).” (Huotari and Hamari 2012)
1. Process of gamification
  1. Define the goals for gamification
    1. Distinguish between *organizational* goals and *user* goals
      1. User-centric goals are **requisite**
        * “…Meaningful gamification puts the needs and goals of the users over the needs of the organization” (Nicholson 2012)
        * “…A concurrent shift towards user-centred design, accounting for the situatedness of the participant.” (Conway 2014)
      1. Supporting user goals can indirectly achieve organizational goals
        * “If users have a positive and meaningful game-based experience that is well-connected to the underlying non-game setting, then the organization will benefit in the long term.” (Nicholson 2012)
  1. Identify user motivations to achieve goals
    1. Motivation theory
      * Theory of 16 basic desires &ndash; Reiss 2004
      * Self-determination theory &ndash; Ryan and Deci 2000; Gagné and Deci 2005
  1. Identify ways to support & reinforce employee motivations with game elements
    1. Motivations that support goal achievement
      1. Use game elements (‘points!’) to provide timely, situated feedback
        * “Feedback needs to be specific and relevant if it is to motivate…. We already know that goals will not be effective without feedback, and performance information helps people clarify expectancies….” (Siegall 1988)
      1. Make sure any rewards communicate the right goals
        * “Reward presented repeatedly in a nonsalient fashion for a high degree of divergent thinking acts to increase subsequent creativity on an entirely new task. …In contrast, rewarding a low degree of originality produces a decrease in generalized creativity.” (Eisenberger and Cameron 1996)
1. Case studies
  1. Compare case studies against the process outlined above
    1. Dos
    1. Do nots
      1. Don't make assumptions about user goals, and don't ignore user goals
        * When users are motivated by idealism, implement mechanics that support idealism, not ones that support seeking status, or fulfilling honor. (Liu *et al.* 2011)
