### Outline

1. What is gamification?
  1. What is a game?
    1. Games are more than a collection of mechanics.  Games are an experience that is born of the interaction of game mechanics, dynamics and themes.

  1. What is gamification?
    1. Gamification tries to create a game-like experience in a non-game setting.  The most obvious indication of gamification is the incorporation of game design elements into a non-game setting.  But mechanics alone do not create a gameful experience; mechanics are the easy part, achieving a gameful experience is the hard part.
      * “…We propose the following definition: ‘Gamification’ is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.” (Deterding *et al.* 2011)
      * “Gamification refers to: ‘a process of enhancing a service with affordances for gameful experiences in order to support user's overall value creation.’ We would like to emphasize that the definition highlights the goal of gamification&mdash;the experiences that it attempt to give rise to&mdash;rather than the methods. Past definitions rely on the notion that gamification is based on the use of game elements. However, there doesn’t seem to exist a clearly defined set of game elements which would be strictly unique to games, neither [do] they automatically create gameful experiences. We can find similar elements from a variety of non-game contexts as well. If we subscribed to the idea that game elements create a game or gamify a system, then we could conclude that also stock exchange dashboard, decision support systems, loyalty programs and other services that have for example levels, points and progression metrics would also be games, regardless of the subjective experiences the users have. Furthermore, gamification is not always carried out through any concrete elements alone. Therefore, we argue that the definition of gamification (nor games) cannot be based on a set of methods or mechanics, but instead it has to be understood more broadly as a process in which the gamifier is attempting to increase the likelihood for the gameful experiences to emerge by imbuing the service with affordances for that purpose (be it badges or more implicit cues).” (Huotari and Hamari 2012)
1. Define the goals for gamification
  1. Distinguish between *organizational* goals and *user* goals
    1. User-centric goals are **requisite**
      * “…Meaningful gamification puts the needs and goals of the users over the needs of the organization” (Nicholson 2012)
      * “…A concurrent shift towards user-centred design, accounting for the situatedness of the participant.” (Conway 2014)
      1. Counter-examples &ndash; ‘what not to do’
        * Don't make assumptions about user goals, and don't ignore user goals
          * E.g., if users are motivated by idealism, implement mechanics that support satiating idealism, not ones that support seeking status, or fulfilling honor. (Liu *et al.* 2011)
    1. Supporting user goals can indirectly achieve organizational goals
      * “If users have a positive and meaningful game-based experience that is well-connected to the underlying non-game setting, then the organization will benefit in the long term.” (Nicholson 2012)
1. Identify user motivations to achieve goals
  1. Motivation theory
    * Theory of 16 basic desires &ndash; Reiss 2004
    * Self-determination theory &ndash; Ryan and Deci 2000; Gagné and Deci 2005
1. Identify ways to support & reinforce employee motivations with game elements
  1. Motivations that support goal achievement
    1. Use game elements (‘points!’) to provide timely, situated feedback
      * “Feedback needs to be specific and relevant if it is to motivate…. We already know that goals will not be effective without feedback, and performance information helps people clarify expectancies….” (Siegall 1988)
    1. Make sure any rewards communicate the right goals
      * “Reward presented repeatedly in a nonsalient fashion for a high degree of divergent thinking acts to increase subsequent creativity on an entirely new task. …In contrast, rewarding a low degree of originality produces a decrease in generalized creativity.” (Eisenberger and Cameron 1996)
  1. Motivations that support employee performance in general
    1. [ Social contact ; Order ; Honor ; Acceptance ]
1. Identify ways to afford a ‘gameful experience’
