## Points!

There are a wide variety of game design elements that might be included in a gamification project, but the most popular, by far, is ‘points!’. Sometimes rebadged as ‘coins’, or ‘karma’, descriptions of various implementations of the intrinsically valueless counters takeup 10 pages in “Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps” (Zichermann 2011).  In “Play at Work: How Games Inspire Breakthrough Thinking”, having a points! element is enough for an application or promotion to be included as an example of “gamification” in our everyday lives.

This identification of points! as synonymous with of gamification is completely specious.

>“What we’re currently terming gamification is in fact the process of taking the thing that is least essential to games and representing it as the core of the experience. Points and badges have no closer a relationship to games than they do to websites and fitness apps and loyalty cards. They’re great tools for communicating progress and acknowledging effort, but neither points nor badges in any way constitute a game. Games just use them&mdash;as primary school teachers, military hierarchies and coffee shops have for centuries&mdash;to help people visualise things they might otherwise lose track of. They are the least important bit of a game, the bit that has the least to do with all of the rich cognitive, emotional and social drivers which gamifiers are intending to connect with.” (Robertson 2010)

The irony is that points! often play an important role in gamification.  But they are not rewards.  They do not motivate users.  When used properly, points! are an effective mechanic to provide feedback, and they can also work as indicators of progress.

Which means that they can be used for both of the requisite characteristics of meaningful play; actions with discernable outcomes, and outcomes that integrate into the overall game experience (Salen and Zimmerman 2004).  Points! can make the outcomes of actions discernable.  And they can be combined from independent outcomes and have an impact on overall gameplay.

What does it mean for points! to be properly implemented?  From a work motivation perspective, “feedback needs to be specific and relevant if it is to motivate and direct” (Siegall 1988).  So, when used as feedback points! must be tied to a specific user action, and they must be tied to the *right* user action.  

Points! as feedback must also be obviously tied to the triggering action. Otherwise, they can have a negative effect on motivation: “When reward is presented independently of performance, people may learn they cannot influence reward presentation, resulting in reduced motivation” (Eisenberger and Cameron 1996).
