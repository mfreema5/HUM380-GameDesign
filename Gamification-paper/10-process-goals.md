## Process of gamification

Gamification is the use of game design methods and elements in the development of non-game applications.  This section focuses on the parts of that process where gamification differs from game design.

The basic gamification process is to identify goals, understand the motivations associated with those goals, develop feedback mechanisms that reinforce those motivations, and outline a progression of intermediate steps to achieve the goals.  Game design is then used to develop mechanisms that track/implement the steps of progression, and that provide appropriate feedback on user actions.

### Goals

The biggest difference between games and gamified systems is the locus of the goals.  The goals in games are within the game itself; in a gamified system the ultimate goals are outside of the game-like parts of the system, or possibly outside of the system entirely. But even though the goals may be outside of the gamified system itself, they are still at the core of the purpose and the process of gamification; similarly, they are also at the core of the values and ethics of the gamification process.




Thus “meaningful gamification puts the needs and goals of the users over the needs of the organization,” though this doesn't mean that the organization is not a beneficiary of a well-gamified system, since “if users have a positive and meaningful game-based experience that is well-connected to the underlying non-game setting… the organization will benefit in the long term” (Nicholson 2012).




1. Process of gamification
  1. Define the goals for gamification
    1. Distinguish between *organizational* goals and *user* goals
      1. User-centric goals are **requisite**
        * “…Meaningful gamification puts the needs and goals of the users over the needs of the organization” (Nicholson 2012)
        * “…A concurrent shift towards user-centred design, accounting for the situatedness of the participant.” (Conway 2014)
      1. Supporting user goals can indirectly achieve organizational goals
        * “If users have a positive and meaningful game-based experience that is well-connected to the underlying non-game setting, then the organization will benefit in the long term.” (Nicholson 2012)





If organizational goals are the center of a gamified system, then the system may be a “technological whip” used by the organization for surveillance, monitoring and performance tracking (Raftopoulos 2014).
