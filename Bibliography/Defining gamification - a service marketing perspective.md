###What’s the article about?

The authors of this article frame &ldquogamification&rdquo in terms of the marketing of services, emphasizing the experience of gamefulness, instead of the systems of games.

###What are the main claims?

>Gamification refers to: *a process of enhancing a service with affordances for gameful experiences in order to support user's overall value creation*.

This article claims that definitions of gamification which rely on distinguishing between game and non-game products are doomed since gamefulness should be understood as an experiential act, and therefore doesn't exist until a player experiences it.

In other words, gamefulness is somewhat akin to Schrödinger's cat; a product is both a game and not a game until such time as a player tries to play it.

###What are the conclusions?

The authors recommend that instead of looking at game elements, you should look at gameful affordances.  Where ‘gameful affordances’ are any quality that adds to the possibility of a player having a gameful experience.  (It's not nearly as flaky as it may sound at first.)

###What questions do you have about the reading?

But how does all this help me to adapt ideas and processes from games and game design into other areas?

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

The authors rely more on making a consistent, compelling argument than on evidence or references.

###What’s missing?

The article fails to explain or propose what can be done with this knowledge.  Instead they offer four possible gamification providers.

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

There's little-to-no evidence, and they fail to properly situate their theory in relation to everything that Deterding, et al. (2011) lay out.  It seems like a compelling argument is being put up against a mountain of well-braced evidence/precedent.
