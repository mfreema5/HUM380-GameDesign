###What’s the article about?

The author presents a generalist How-To for the gamification of customer support.

###What are the main claims?

Gamification of a technical support system through adding points systems, scoreboards, badges, rewards, etc., will have &ldquosignificant positive effects&rdquo on outcomes.  Customers will be motivated to create support content and to self-server; support personel will show an increase in job satisfaction and positivity, and will provide better customer service.

###What are the conclusions?

If you do gamification right, it works.  So, if it doesn't work, you probably did it wrong.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

How is the author proposing anything other than measuring key perfomance indicators?  The only variation seems to be that the results of measurements are made extremely public and prominent.


###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

No evidence is directly discussed.  The sources referenced as support for claims are of questionable veracity, e.g., a consulting firm's wiki-page, which is only ever updated by the founder and CEO of the firm.  (http://enterprise-gamification.com/index.php/en/facts)

###What’s missing?

The author ascribes the increasing difficulty in leveling entirely to an artifice to ramp up player investment.  What he ignores is the possibility that the additional skills required to make the next level are more complex and harder to master.

If you tie a leveling system to actual skill acquisition, then the difficulty between levels will naturally increase.

The author hints at the possible value of gamifying the training process, but doesn't give any details, or explain the possible analogs between time/investment and acquiring complex skills inside a game and outside of it.

He also fails to use gamification to help explain his points:

>The monotony of a support engineer’s job often causes engineers to lose interest in their job and cut corners. Gamification can help to both reward complex tasks and encourage the following of rote processes that have little intrinsic reward for their completion. (pg. 289)

An obvious way to gamify that issue is to discuss it as sending player with a high-level character in an massively-multiplayer online role-playing game on a low-level quest.  It's inevitable that they will get bored and wander off the established path for completing the quest; perhaps intentionally &ldquodoing things the hard way&rdquo.

Points and badges and such won't stop that player from being bored.  It's not going to stop the technician from being bored, either.

A better way to gamify the problem of technicians bored be rote tasks is match the level of the technician to the level of the task.  Instead of assigning points to the technician, maybe more time needs to be spent assigning points to the tasks they're given?

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

It's a whole lot of hype with very little evidence.  It cuts a broad swathe through complex issues and fails to really understand what makes games different from play, and work.
