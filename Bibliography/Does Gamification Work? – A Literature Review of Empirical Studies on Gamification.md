###What’s the article about?

This article is a literature review of empirical studies of gamification.

###What are the main claims?

The article is intending to determine the efficacy of gamification by looking at the results of a collection of empirical studies.

###What are the conclusions?

The article claims that the empirical evidence supports the notion that gamification has positive impact on motivation and engagement outcomes.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

I was wondering if the authors would touch on effect size at all.  They did not.

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

The article presents as evidence a thorough summary of the results of the avialable empirical studies related to gamification

###What’s missing?

There is still not much of a connection between gamification and non-game goals.  Yes, users are engaging with the systems more often and/or for longer, but is that producing accelerated advancement toward user goals?

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

Apparently, there's a lack of rigor in many of the empirical studies.  I get the impression that people don't take gamification entirely seriously, so sloppy work is considered acceptable.
