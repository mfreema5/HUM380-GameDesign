###What’s the article about?

This article is not directly about &ldquogamification&rdquo.  However, since the issue of motivation comes up repeatedly in gamification research, this article seems relevant.  It details a framework of 16 basic desires through which to understand human behaviors, and gives some basic empirical justification for them.
