Kim, Sangkyun. 2013. &ldquo;Recent Advances in Gamification Application.&rdquo; *Advances in Information Sciences & Service Sciences* 5 (13). http://www.aicit.org/AISS/ppl/AISS3629PPL.pdf.

###Who is the author?

* Sangkyun Kim &ndash; Associate Professor, Department of Industrial Engineering, Kangwon National University, Republic of Korea

###What’s the article about?

This article is a literature review of case studies about gamification.

###What are the main claims?

The article both claims that gamification will accelerate the globalization of applications, and that the article will accelerate the globalization of gamification.

###What are the conclusions?

The article implies that the existence of gamified applications demonstrates that they are effective.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

I wonder about the diffusion of gamification-related terms and concepts.  It seems like most of the example applications are some form of leaderboard element, but that term is only used once in the text.

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

There's no results of any sort.  A number of gamified applications are covered briefly, but there's no mention what impact&mdash;positive or negative&mdash;any of them had.

###What’s missing?

This article is very sparse on useful information.

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

There are no outcomes from gamification reported, and 1/8 of the references are self-references.
