###What’s the article about?

This article is the final follow-up on the gamification of a social networking system; the authors explore the effects of removing the gamification.

###What are the main claims?

The article claims that there is a correlation between having a points system that rewards participation in an corporate social network.

###What are the conclusions?

If adding a points system raises participation, removing that points system will lower participation.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

What is the non-game goal for users that the gamification is supposed to enhance?

They report that short, low-value posts &ldquosubsided&rdquo after removing points system.  Did the compare proportions of long-to-short posts?  Did the points system only increase noise, and not signal?

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

The result of statistical analysis of empirical evidence is given in the article.

###What’s missing?

There's no interpretation of the statistical analysis beyond saying that the independent and dependent variable are positively correlated.  They don't discuss the size of the effect.

There's also no comparison of participation rates from before and after the entire experiment.  The participation rate dropped after removing the points system, but did it drop below what the participation rate was before any points system existed?

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

There's only an incomplete discussion of the *quality* of participation.  When participation rates dropped after removing the points system, did the overall quality of participation go up?  A simple word-count might have shed some light on that question.  Or may an *en mass* spell-check of postings (presumably lower quality posts also have lower quality spelling and grammar, because the users don't care).

Though, the big gaping hole remains: What was the non-game goal that gamification was intended to help users achieve?  Merely participating would seem to be the in-game goal.
