###What’s the article about?

This is a follow-up empirical study of the effects of the gamification of a social-networking site.

###What are the main claims?

The basic claim of this article is that a points system on an internal corporate social networking system will increase the amount of user activity.

###What are the conclusions?

The qualitative and quantitative results of the study both show an increase in user activity.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

What is the underlying non-game goal that all this is intended to help users achieve?

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

The article includes aggregated qualitative results.  It also includes statistical analysis of quantitative results, and charts of that information.

###What’s missing?

The explanation of the quantitative results doesn't seem complete.

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

I'm a bit baffled as to why the first qualitative analysis cncerning the impact of sending an email notifying users about their points on the system included those users who did not have the points system.  The article says they were included as a control, but to control for what?  They demonstrated in a later analysis that the two groups&mdash;users with the points system, and those without&mdash;behaved differently.  How can a group that behaves differently act as a control group?

The results are then described as &ldquo;not statistically significant&rdquo;, but no confidence level is listed.  Not statistically significant at 95%, 90%, 80%?  But it's something of a moot point, since the authors then say that the evidence supports their claim, despite failing to reject the null hypothesis.
