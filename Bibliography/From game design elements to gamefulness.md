###What’s the article about?

This article examines the history of the concept of &ldquogamification&rdquo, and how it relates to similar concepts.  It proposes a definition for gamification: *The use of game design elements in non-game contexts*.

###What are the main claims?

The major claim is the gamification is a new and distinct phenomenon, and should therefore be studied.

###What are the conclusions?

The article concludes that gamefulness is distinct from playfulness, and that design intended to add gamefulness to a non-game is worth studying.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

Is gamification really just &ldquoslapping a points system onnit&rdquo?

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

The authors cite an extensive number of reputable sources.

###What’s missing?

Game metaphors/themes/narratives are largely missing.  I presume these all fall under &ldquogame models&rdquo in the levels of abstraction of game elements that the authors give.  But how they have been adapted to non-games, or if that would qualify as gamification is unclear.  Is applying (or borrowing) a metaphor gamification?  Yes, if it the purpose is to increase gamefulness.

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

I'm not seeing many weaknesses.  This paper seems to be often cited whenever people want to make a claim to &ldquogamification&rdquo, and that's not surprising.
