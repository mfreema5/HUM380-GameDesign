###What’s the article about?

This article tells about using the first-person-shooter game &ldquoDoom&rdquo as an interface for Windows&trade; Task Manager.

###What are the main claims?

Using the complete interface from a game as the front-end for system administration software would make system administration tasks more fun.

Since aggressive language is used to describe system administration tasks associated with monitoring, and modifying, running processes on a computer (&ldquokilling&rdquo, etc.), the first-person-shooter game &ldquoDoom&rdquo should make an appropriate front-end.

###What are the conclusions?

Despite the alignment of language about &ldquospawning daemons&rdquo, and &ldquokilling&rdquo applications, the metaphor of Doom does not match very well to the actual task at hand.  In particular, while some monsters are more deadly than others, they all appear deadly.  There was no mechanism in PSDoom for distinguishing well-behave processes/monsters, or for flagging the critical ones.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

Did the author/developer consider making more significant changes to the Doom front-end, in order see if it could be made to map to the system administration tasks more accurately?

What if a user didn't have experience in playing Doom?  Would they also fall into the narrative of the game, and start killing all processes without differentiation?

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

All the evidence is anecdotal, and reported by the author as coming from personal emails and similar communications.

###What’s missing?

The entire point of this instance of gamification is to make work more fun.  There's no exploration of other ways gamification might the user experience of performing tasks at work.

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

PSDoom is obviously not meant to be an entirely serious or thorough experiment in gamification.  It also lacks any sort of real evidence of the outcomes&mdash;you could write this article, an get the same results and conclusion, without ever actually producing a working version of PSDoom.  I'm not proposing the article is fictitious, but rather it fails to present anything compelling or even surprising.
