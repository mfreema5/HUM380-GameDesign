#A User-Centered Theoretical Framework for Meaningful Gamification

Nicholson, S. 2012. &ldquo;A User-Centered Theoretical Framework for Meaningful Gamification.&rdquo; In *GLS 8.0 Conference Proceedings*. Madison, WI, USA: ETC Press.

###Who is the author?

* Scott Nicholson &ndash; Associate Professor, School of Information Studies, Syracuse University

###What’s the article about?

One criticism of using gamification to motivate users, is that often an internal motivation is replaced with an external one.  In this article the author looks at ways to use gamification to create/enhance intrinsic motivations.

###What are the main claims?

That the &ldquo;slap a points system onnit&rdquo; approach of gamification is intended to improve the outcomes for the organization, not the people using the gamified system.

###What are the conclusions?

That gamification needs to be user-centric to be effective.

The author proposes a modification to the definition given by Deterding, *et al.* (2011):

>Meaningful gamification is the integration of user-centered game design elements into non-game contexts.

Though, I wonder if he has seen the Huotari and Hamari (2012) experiential-based definition.  It's inherently user-centric, since the user calls the gamefulness into being through her experience with the service system in question.

The author avers that successful gamification systems:

* are transparent in their constraints
* offer multiple ways to achieve the non-game goals, and
* allow users to take part in creating the systems.

###What questions do you have about the reading?

Was this article written in direct response to Sampanes (2013)?  Because the discussion of points systems seem to derail most every example that Sampanes gave.

The author points out that users are less likely to care about a points system if it is tied to a non-game activity that they do not care about&mdash;in other words, you can't make an employee engaged in improving a task merely by measuring improvement in gamified points.  And, along those same lines, using external rewards to control behavior &ldquo;creates a negative feeling in the user&rdquo;.

###What’s the evidence for each of those claims?

There's an unfortunate paucity of evidence.  The argument are compelling, and the author brings in references from a diverse range of fields.  But there's just a scattering of references, overall.

###What’s missing?

The article lacks good examples.  The examples that are given&mdash;a set of stairs in a subway in Sweden, the Toyota Prius dashboard, and Alternate Reality Games&mdash;do more harm than good.  They're weak, and their applicability isn't obvious.

###What are the weaknesses in those claims and evidence?

The arguments are compelling, so I don't see the claims as wel, bu the article seems short on supporting evidence/references.
