#Fundamentals of Game Design &ndash; HUM380

##Jan 12 2015


Dr. Kocurek (kah-sir-ick)

* Most game design is based on rule sets
  * "effective sets of rules"

Prof. Kocurek defines groups for projects

Minor project:
  Reverse specify an existing game
    Your submission goes to another group, who attempts to create the game

“assignments are due at the beginning of class on the specified date”

##Bad Game Designs

####Tic-Tac-Toe

* Tic-tac-toe is a “solved” game
  * Not much “joy” to be had in playing

* Fix it


All known winning moves for Chess are known (thanks to computers)

Not all known winning moves are known for Go
  Too many permutations


----

Not all games are supposed to be “fun”

Might be:
* Stimulating
* Satisfying
* Rewarding

Games should be “engaging” &ndash; “people should want to play”

* Many games are “based on Apples to Apples”
  * Based on “one mechanic”

* ***Iteration* is a key design principle.**
  * Every game breaks
  * Test early-and-often to break early
  * Late breaks are more expensive

* Normal cycle for game design in 18 months

* **Always need pen and paper for class**
