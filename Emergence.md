>My belief is that the explanation of emergent phenomena in our brains...for instance ideas, hopes, images, analogies, and finally consciousness and free will...are based on a kind of Strange Loop, an interaction between levels in which the top level reaches back towards the bottom level and influences it, while at the same time being itself determined by the bottom level. &ndash; Hofstadter; *Goedel, Escher, Bach*; p. 709

>Finally, Hofstadter relates this emergent complexity to creativity, making the point that determinism does not rule out creativity because there is more than enough pseudorandomness in any sufficiently large deterministic system to give rise to unpredictable, ‘creative’ results.” &ndash; Jesse Rohwer; *Commentary on Douglas Hofstadter's Gödel, Escher, Bach*; [http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/complexity/course/emergence06/bookreviews/jrohwer.html](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/complexity/course/emergence06/bookreviews/jrohwer.html)
