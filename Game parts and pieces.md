###Playing Cards ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0t6PBypahI))

1. Sleeves method
  * Easiest and cheapest way to get uniform cards
  * Make cards on plain paper
  * Insert into protective sleeve
  * Also insert “stiffener” into sleeve
    * “Junk trading cards” make good stiffeners
2. Card stock
  * Easier to shuffle and use than sleeved cards
  * Print cards on plain card stock
    * “110# index” card stock
    * Laser printing is more durable than inkjet printing
  * Cutting cards
    * Watch [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0t6PBypahI) for details of cutting cards
    * Use a *good* paper cutter
    * To layout cuts:
      * Use guide sheet, or
      * Print extra copy of one page on plain paper
    * Two cuts
      1. Separate cards
      2. Trim edges to make cards uniform
        * height is more important than width
    * Use a corner rounding tool to trim corners
      * Cards will shuffle better
3. Full sheet labels (*not* pre-cut labels)
  * Print cards onto labels, stick labels to playing cards
  * Base cards &ndash; best have a “linen finish”
  * Steps
    * Print cards to label sheet
    * Cut cards to slightly smaller than base cards
    * Stick cards to base cards
  * Easier to shuffle if you *don't* do a backside
    * Adding a backside to base looks better, though
