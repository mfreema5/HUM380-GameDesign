## Defining games

* What is a game?
  * Activity with rules
  * Something with a clear objective
  * A serious of meaningful decisions

* Game design as a creative activity

* Examples of decisions in game
  * FreeCiv
    * Where to spend resources
    * What technology path to emphasize

Decision trees

There is a narrative world behind chess, but the moves are not narrative themselves&mdash;you don't describe the play of the game with the narrative.

Options like re-skinning a base, changing avatar colors, etc., are meaningless to the mechanics but are meaningful to the play experience.

* What is game design?
  * An iterative process
  * A flexible process
  * A creative process
  * “An art”

* “The mechanic is the message.”
  * Systems carry message

* Game as narrative
  * Example: “Middle passage”
    * Slave trade from Africa to US
      * Over land --> over sea --> over land
    * How to include the emotional impact of the middle passage?
      * Make a game
        * Create characters
        * Put all characters in boat
        * Kill characters at random
