#Gamification of collaborating on a document

To gamify the process of document creation by a team, first you break the document down into separate sections, and create a &ldquo;slot&rdquo; in a virtual workspace for each section document.

Everyone on the team can create any section document, as long as that section document's slot is empty.  But, each team member can only create a limited number of section documents.  So, no single team member can create the entire document by creating every section.

In the virtual workspace, team members can see the status of the section document slots.  The status is either: empty, locked, or viewable.  A &ldquo;locked&rdquo; slot is being held for a team member who is working on creating that section document.  However, slots can only be locked for a limited amount of time before automatically reverting to &ldquo;empty&rdquo;.

Once a section document is in its slot, only the originating team member can make revisions to it.  Other team members can view, mark-up, and comment on the document, but not actually make changes.

There are a number of intra-process deadlines.  A deadline for making initial drafts of every section.  Then sequential deadlines for: comments on first drafts; revision of sections; comments on revisions; and final sectional revisions.

In the virtual workspace, team members can see every team member's activities, both as a per-team-member summary, and as a per-section-document-slot summary.

Once all the section documents have been revised twice by their respective authors, the document is concatenated together, and team members can comment on the entire document.  The team leader then either does or coordinates the final revision of the entire document.
